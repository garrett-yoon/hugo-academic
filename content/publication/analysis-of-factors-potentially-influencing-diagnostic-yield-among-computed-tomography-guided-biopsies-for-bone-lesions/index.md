summary: This study aimed to investigate patient-specific, lesion-related, and technical factors that potentially influence diagnostic yield of computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies of bone lesions. Computed tomography-guided bone lesion biopsies performed over a 2-year period were retrospectively reviewed, including image review and electronic medical records for pathology reports and clinical follow-up. Lesions were tabulated by prebiopsy CT and magnetic resonance imaging features. Patients with nondiagnostic biopsies were assessed for presumptive clinical diagnosis and management. Nondiagnostic pathology results were obtained in 31 of 156 cases (19.87%), among which diagnoses were confirmed by other tissue sampling in 9; clinical follow-up of up to 2 years yielded no diagnosis in 10 and presumptive diagnoses in 12. The nondiagnostic biopsy rate of long bone lesions was higher than that of other bone lesions (odds ratio, 3.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-9.09). There were no significant differences in patient American Society of Anesthesiologists class, mean body mass index, sedation method, number of cores, or needle gauge between diagnostic and nondiagnostic biopsy cohorts. Diagnostic yield was not significantly different between occult, lytic, or sclerotic lesions. There was no difference in diagnostic yield regarding presence of cortical break, gadolinium enhancement, or lesion depth. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained before biopsy in significantly more nondiagnostic cases compared with diagnostic cases ( P = 0.027). Computed tomography-guided biopsies had a nondiagnostic rate of 19.87%, and lesions in the long bones of the extremities were disproportionately common among this group. There was no significant association between biopsy results and several patient-specific, lesion-related, and technical factors.
