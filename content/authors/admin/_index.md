I am a 4th year MD/MS at NYU Grossman School of Medicine entering radiology. I completed a masters in biomedical informatics at NYU Vilcek Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. I am interested in the use of predictive modeling, computer vision, and clinical decision support to improve medicine.
