I am a current preliminary medicine resident starting radiology residency in 2023. I completed a masters in biomedical informatics at NYU Vilcek Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. I am interested in the use of predictive modeling, computer vision, and clinical decision support to improve medicine.
